# DateTime
Date and time library based on Howard Hinnant's date and timezone libraries

The date and timezones folders, as well as tz.cpp are modified versions of those in Howard Hinnant's library, albeit an older version

With the inclusion of this functionality into std::chrono in C++ 20, those dependencies can likely be removed.
